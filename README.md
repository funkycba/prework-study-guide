# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I wanted to make up for my past mistakes and everything I missed in my previous course for coding.. This project is meant to be my first stepping stone to allow me to grasp the basics of programming and transition to the more advanced forms of coding. These solutions I have help with the problems of figuring out the definitions of three essential interface programs: html, css, and js.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
